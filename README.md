Chrome extension that replaces words/phrases that are predictably used to dehumanize people with other words/phrases that are more humanizing. The goal is to provide real-time translations that maximize both [doxastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_logic) and [semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_theory_of_truth) validity.

### Decode the American language!
