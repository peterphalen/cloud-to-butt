humanize
=============

![](logo.png)

#### Decode the American language!
- Illegals -> humans
- Illegal alien -> human trying to build a better life
- Dangerous thug -> black person who I am afraid of
- Organized thugs -> organized black people 

This chrome extension replaces words that are predictably used to dehumanize people with different words that are more humanizing. The goal is to maximize both [doxastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_logic) and [semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_theory_of_truth#Tarski.27s_theory) translational validity. That is to say: we want to be less distracted by the words that people use, and more aware of the real live human people who they are talking about.
